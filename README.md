##  Introduction

This  project  was  realized  during our third year of  study  at  Epitech. This project aim to  develop  a web dashboard which  allows  users  to  subscribe  to predefined services  such as  Youtube, Twitch,  Github... Users  can  display  different  information in therms of their  subscription. We had three weeks to develop this project  (Including React and Node learning). We used [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/) and [AdonisJs](https://adonisjs.com/) to create this dashboard.

## How to run it?

 - Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:M4gie/EPI_dashboard_2019`
    
 - Move `api-docker-compose.env.exemple` to `api-docker-compose.env` and fill it
 
 - Fill `front/.env.production`

 - Run `docker-compose build`
 
 - Run `docker-compose up -d`
 
 - Run `make && make seed`
 
 Now you can access to the dashboard with http://localhost:8080
